Use the bao_data to constrain the time-dependent dark energy. The equation of state for dark energy is $w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a)$.

The parameters are setted according to planck best fit, i.e. $H_0=67.36,\Omega_m=0.3153,rs=147.09/{\rm Mpc}$. For simplicity, ignore the radiation contributions. Note that the dark energy contribution is determined by $\Omega_{\rm DE}=1-\Omega_m$â€‹ in flat universe. From energy conservation we have

$$
\dot \rho+3H(\rho+p)=0\\
d\ln \rho=-3(1+w)d\ln a\\
\rho\propto \exp[-3\int(1+w)d\ln a]\\
\rightarrow \rho\propto (1+z)^{3(1+w_0+w_a)}e^{3w_a(a-1)}\\
H^2=H_0^2(\Omega_m(1+z)^3+(1-\Omega_m)(1+z)^{3(1+w_0+w_a)}e^{3w_a(a-1)})
$$

**Get some samples for the two free parameters $w_0,w_a$ and plot a contour. Does your result favor $\Lambda$CDM?**
