Use the bao_data to constrain the time-dependent dark energy. The equation of state for dark energy is $w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a)$.

The parameters are setted according to planck best fit, i.e. $H_0=67.36,\Omega_m=0.3153,rs=147.09/{\rm Mpc}$. For simplicity, ignore the radiation contributions. Note that the dark energy contribution is determined by $\Omega_{\rm DE}=1-\Omega_m$ in flat universe.

**Get some samples for the two free parameters $w_0,w_a$ and plot a contour. Does your result favor $\Lambda$CDM?**
